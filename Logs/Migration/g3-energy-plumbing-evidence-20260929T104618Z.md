# G3 Evidence — Energy status, Plumbing single-flight, B1 reading — 2026-09-29T10:46:18Z (2026-09-29 00:46:18 HST)

| Item | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy `solar-gate-status` (read-only) | PASS | Script only `cat`s `/home/rootrecord/Database/ENERGY/ports/solar-gate-state.json` (no BLE, no writes; identical logic to G2). Run once 2026-09-29T10:43:09Z from Pacific `Energy/scripts/actions/` → `WAITING` / `No data - solar gate state not written yet`, exit 2 (the designed honest no-data answer; the gate has never been armed). |
| Energy actuating actions (arm/disarm, AC always-on on/off) | VERIFY PENDING | They change hardware state via BLE; not run (no approved actuation). |
| Plumbing non-NPU single-flight | PASS (after mode fix) | First try 10:44:24Z failed: `run-ollama.sh` → `single-flight.sh: Permission denied` (exit 126) — Pacific `run-infer.sh`, `run-ollama.sh`, `single-flight.sh` were mode 644 (G2 copies are 755). Restored 775 (git mode 100644 → 100755). Retry 10:45:00Z: `run-ollama.sh qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct-q8_0 "Reply with exactly one word: ok"` → `[ok] single-flight RUN …` / `Ok`, exit 0 in ~4 s; a parallel `single-flight.sh run` during it was refused (`[busy]`, exit 75); holder written then cleared under `/home/rootrecord/Database/GITHUB/plumbing/state`; lock `/run/user/1000/rootrecord-inference.lock`. |
| Plumbing NPU (FLM) | BLOCKED | unchanged: no FLM binary / service; `:52625` unreachable. |
| B1 = River 2 Pro reading 0% | Finding only | See below. |

## B1 (River 2 Pro) = 0% — read-only finding

- B1 is `river2pro` (River 2 Pro, role `laptop_ac_car_dc`). Its readings come from the EcoFlow cloud API (`source: api` in every sample and in `Database/ENERGY/soc/river2pro-last.json`). BLE is not a data source: the BLE owner is a heartbeat-only process, and no BLE action ran tonight.
- From 23:40 to 00:19 HST the API returned the same values 24 times (`soc=26% ac_out=73W usbc=56W`). After a gap in river2pro reads (00:19:17 → 00:24:37 HST), every read (12 so far) is `soc=0% ac_out=73W usbc=95W`.
- At about 129–168 W of reported output, 26% of a River 2 Pro should last well over an hour, and the values stayed identical for 40 minutes. So the API snapshots update rarely: the drop to 0% is either a late report of a real deep discharge or an API/device reporting artifact. From the desk it cannot be told apart; check the River 2 Pro display.
- Not caused by the migration: it started at 00:24:37 HST, before both cutovers (00:33 / 00:35 HST), and the data path is the API. The desk itself is on mains (`ACAD online=1`; laptop battery 83%, charging).
