# jobs.py additions — 2026-09-29 migration pass (exact blocks)

Pacific `Automations/scripts/jobs.py`, added 13:21–13:44 HST by the migration pass (desk agent). **Standing rule received afterwards (13:45 HST): jobs.py is not to be edited unless Alexander asks or a work order requires it.** Per that instruction these edits are **left in place, not reverted**; keeping them registered is a **sign-off item** for Alexander. Every block is gated OFF (`enabled` reads an env flag once at poller import); the running poller (PID 105444, started 03:13:28 HST) was not restarted, so none is active. The `smart_devices_collect` block between them belongs to another agent's pass and is not listed here.

Why jobs.py: the task asked to register each periodic port disabled/gated so it takes effect at the next poller start; jobs.py is the only job registry the poller reads. Alternative if Alexander prefers: remove these blocks and keep the same text in the domain READMEs as the line to add.
